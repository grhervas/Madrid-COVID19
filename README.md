# Madrid-COVID19

This is a simple web application deployed through RStudio's *Shiny* apps, designed to show the impact of confinement on socioeconomic aspects of the population of Madrid, the capital of Spain. The application can be accessed via the following link (sorry if it is down...):  https://gonzalorh.shinyapps.io/Madrid_COVID19/

The data for this study comes from a survey carried out by the Madrid City Council and accessible through its portal: https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.c05c1f754a33a9fbe4b2e4b284f1a5a0/?vgnextoid=79c6ec6846c22710VgnVCM2000001f4a900aRCRD&vgnextchannel=374512b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default

The inspiration for this project came from an assignment for a Data Visualization course in my Master's program.

Hope you like it!
